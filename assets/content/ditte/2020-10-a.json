  "text": "Hi friends, <br><br>\n\nI'm super excited to show you Pre-Fall 21 - our Copenhagen homecoming collection. We’ve always said, home is where our heart is. And these past months we have fallen in love with Copenhagen all over again. It feels good to bring it back to Copenhagen, looking at the people, designing with that way of life in mind. Clothes where you’re always on the go, and a bike is your number one accessory. <br><br>\n\nBack when the lockdown started in Copenhagen, one of my highlights was virtual happy hour with my team and friends. My signature drink is a Kir Royale - not super Danish, but it reminds me of fun times and past GANNI parties.  <br><br>\n\nHave a drink with us, and get to know our new collection, GANNI Style. <br><br>\n\nFrom Copenhagen, with love!<br><br>\n\nx Ditte <br><br>\n\n<b>KIR ROYALE<b><br>\nIngredients: <br><br>\n \n1/3 oz (1 part) Crème de cassis<br>\n3 oz (9 parts) Champagne<br>\nPrep: Add the crème de cassis to the bottom of your glass, then top up with champagne.<br>\nServing suggestion: Dancing on table, optional<br>\nSkål <3 \n\n",
