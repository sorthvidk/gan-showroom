  "text": "WORMS FOR BREAKFAST\n\nNot far from the GANNI HQâ€™s coffee machine, we just got our very own worm farm. A gift by our founder Nicolaj Reffstrup, our new friends make up a high-protein meal or easy snack. A low-impact alternative to other animal protein, which takes up little land and can be produced in most climates.  Stanford Research shows that mealworms can safely consume toxic additive-containing plastic, and still be used as safe feedstock for other animals. Meaning our little friends may play a vital role in solving the global waste issue.",
