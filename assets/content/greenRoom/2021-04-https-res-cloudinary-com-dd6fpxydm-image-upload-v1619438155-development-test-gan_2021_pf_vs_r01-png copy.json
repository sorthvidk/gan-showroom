  "text": "ACCELERATING THE USE OF RESPONSIBLE MATERIALS\n\nIn every new collection we launch we aim to increase the % of responsible materials. A development that can be credited to the UNDP @sdgaction Accelerator programme, where we worked towards accelerating our use of responsible and recycled materials. Alongside our key organic and recycled alternatives, our sourcing team are always looking for weird and wonderful new solutions for conventional materials. Our aim is to reach 100% responsible materials across future collections. We classify styles as responsible when at least 50% of the composition is certified recycled or organic.\n\n\nStay tuned as we introduce bio-based alternatives like cactus leather - a new kind of 'leather' inspired by the desert to keep you looking sharp",
