  "text": "NO EXCUSES: WHAT WE ACTUALLY MEAN WHEN WE SAY WE'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE\n\nWe're not sustainable. We've been saying this since 2013 when we took the first few steps towards a more responsible version of ourselves. It was never intended as an excuse, but simply a reflection of how,we at GANNI, perceive the world. We had three reasons back then that are still relevant today. \n\nWe’re a fashion brand thriving off of newness, this is inherently not sustainable. There’s no denying that. \n\nWe were afraid of being called out for greenwashing. We obviously weren’t doing enough about sustainability and we still aren’t. It’s a never ending journey and we can never do enough to minimize our impact. \n\nWe didn’t want to center the GANNI narrative around sustainability. We believe that in the future all fashion brands will have to be sustainable either by law or through customer demand. So in the long run, behaving sustainably won't be a unique positioning, but rather a prerequisite for doing business. \n\nSo we decided to keep our heads down and get to work, until we were ready to join the conversation. Over the years more and more brands started to approach consumers with stories about sustainability. At the same time, to many, GANNI was perceived as just a conventional fashion brand with no agenda on acting responsibly - and with good reason, because we weren’t communicating our efforts. \n\nThat’s when we decided to initiate a dialogue around responsibility and to engage our community in our journey towards becoming impact free. We realised we needed to be more transparent about both our shortcomings and progress. Creating a platform dedicated to sharing a more elaborate view on sustainability, what behaving responsibly actually entails and how complex and ambiguous it really is. So we launched #GANNILAB.  \n\n•\nAs April has come to end we’re looking back at a month where we published our third annual responsibility report, we participated in #FashionRevolutionWeek, rolled out RePack globally, published all of our Tier 1 Suppliers in the Open Apparel Registry and launched a collection with Ahluwalia made entirely from reworked styles and leftover fabrics. As we move into May we look forward to launching our Pre Fall collection consisting of 71% responsible* materials.\n•\nOur 44 GamePlan goals is a results-driven approach to sustainability. Having initiated 41 out of 44 goals, achieving our game plan by 2023 doesn’t feel like a distant reality anymore, but we need to keep investing and hold ourselves accountable through transparency to get there.\n•\nOur approach is still to be honest, not perfect and we’re willing to take the risks and hits along the way. The ambition is still to one day become a truly sustainable fashion brand and the dream is still that ultimately this will not differentiate us from other fashion brands. But until we get there we still identify as a responsible brand that isn’t sustainable yet. Not as an excuse but as an ambition that drives us every day to become a better version of ourselves on our journey towards sustainability. \n\nTake a look for yourself in our Responsibility Report, ask questions and hold the brands you buy from accountable. #GANNILab  ",
