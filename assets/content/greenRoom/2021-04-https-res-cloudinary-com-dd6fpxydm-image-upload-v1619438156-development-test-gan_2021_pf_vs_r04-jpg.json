  "text": "<span class=“big”>NO EXCUSES: WHAT WE ACTUALLY MEAN WHEN WE SAY WE'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE<span>\n\nWe're not sustainable. We've been saying this since 2013 when we took the first few steps towards a more responsible version of ourselves. It was never intended as an excuse, but simply a reflection of how, we at GANNI, perceive the world. We had three reasons back then that are still relevant today. \n\nWe’re a fashion brand thriving off of newness, this is inherently not sustainable. There’s no denying that. \n\nWe were afraid of being called out for greenwashing. We obviously weren’t doing enough about sustainability and we still aren’t. It’s a never ending journey and we can never do enough to minimize our impact. \n\nWe didn’t want to center the GANNI narrative around sustainability. We believe that in the future all fashion brands will have to be sustainable either by law or through customer demand. So in the long run, behaving sustainably won't be a unique positioning, but rather a prerequisite for doing business. \n\nSo we decided to keep our heads down and get to work, until we were ready to join the conversation. Over the years more and more brands started to approach consumers with stories about sustainability. At the same time, to many, GANNI was perceived as just a conventional fashion brand with no agenda on acting responsibly - and with good reason, because we weren’t communicating our efforts. \n\nThat’s when we decided to initiate a dialogue around responsibility and to engage our community in our journey towards becoming impact free. We realised we needed to be more transparent about both our shortcomings and progress. Creating a platform dedicated to sharing a more elaborate view on sustainability, what behaving responsibly actually entails and how complex and ambiguous it really is. So we launched @GANNILAB.  ",
