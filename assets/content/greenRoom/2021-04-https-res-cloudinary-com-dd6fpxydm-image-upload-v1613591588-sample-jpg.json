As we continue our responsibility journey, we’re learning that fully understanding our impact is key in reducing it.\n\nWe’re proud to announce that we’re stepping up our carbon mapping efforts, investing in an even further understanding of our CO2 footprint, that covers the materials we use to the electricity supplier at our stores.\n\nOur new partner @planaearth helps us target the heaviest points of our value chain, giving us stronger and more accurate data than ever before, making us equipped to drive meaningful and structural change. It will see an increase in information sharing, that will translate into more ambitious reduction targets for our entire value chain.\n•\nAll of this is to help support us in minimizing our impact, in line with GANNI being a signatory of the UN Fashion Charter for Climate Action.\n•\nIt is never too late to change your ways, but as a fashion company change must come now. Our industry accounts for 4% of global emissions. Emissions that must be cut in half, if we are to do our part in avoiding a temperature increase above 1,5 celsius, a global limit set in the 2015 Paris Agreement*. Follow us and @planaearth in our journey minimizing our impact. We’ll keep you posted on our progress with reducing our CO2 footprint and can’t wait to share more with you soon #GANNILab #noplanbfortheplanet #offsetting\n\n*Fashion on Climate, McKinsey",
