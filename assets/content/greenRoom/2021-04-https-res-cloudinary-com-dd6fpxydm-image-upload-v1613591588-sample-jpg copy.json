  "text": "<span class=“big”>UN WOMEN EMPOWERMENT PRINCIPLES</span>\n\n90% of our employees identify as female, and most of our customer base, making women the heart of everything we do. When we signed the UN Women Empowerment Pinciples, we took a stance on female Empowerment and gender equality.\n\nWe want to have an intersectional approach, empowering all people across our business. Our work towards securing diversity, inclusion and supply chain traceability are interchangeable from our work on gender equality.\n\nIn 2021 we’ll continue working on obtaining gender split information from over 200 suppliers, structuring our work on gender equality and ensuring all is applicable throughout our entire supply chain.
