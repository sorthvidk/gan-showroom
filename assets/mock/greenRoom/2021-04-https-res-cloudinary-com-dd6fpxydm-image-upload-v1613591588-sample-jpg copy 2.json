Hundreds of billions of polybags are estimated to be produced for the fashion industry every year.\nSince signing the @ellenmacarthurfoundation commitment to eliminate virgin & single-use plastic by 2025, we have partnered with @originalrepack to avoid single-use plastics for GANNI.com orders, and introduced FSC certified paper bags. What is left is an annual plastic consumption of 51.177 tonnes. Polybags alone account for half.\nOur next collection, Pre Fall 2021, will be delivered with much less plastic waste as we have managed to reduce the size of certain polybags with up to 40%, by folding the clothes more compactly. It’s not as easy as it sounds!\n\nGet the full story in our 2020 Responsibility Report",
