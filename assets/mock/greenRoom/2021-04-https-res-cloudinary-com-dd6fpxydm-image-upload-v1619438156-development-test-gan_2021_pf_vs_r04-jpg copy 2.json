Around 40% of our samples require a second proto-type. This is the phase we are trying to cut down on. Our aim is to use @itsclo3d to visualise the design and technical aspects to become less reliant on back and forth sample rounds with suppliers.\n\n'We’ve just dipped our toes in @itsclo3d, but the possibilities for what we can do seem endless. We just began working with a fabric scanner, making the sketches extremely lifelike,' explains garment technician Louise Bistrup Strøm.\nStay tuned, we’ll make sure to keep you updated on our digital endeavours",
