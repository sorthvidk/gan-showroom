  "text": "MATERIALS MATTER - HOW WE CLASSIFY A MATERIAL AS RESPONSIBLE\n\nThe materials we use account for +80% our total environmental impact. From raw material to GANNI style, textiles go through upward of 10 suppliers and manufacturing processes, being the main origin of a garment’s footprint.\n\nWe have set ourselves the goal of using 100% Responsible in line with minimising our impact and for SS21 we managed to make 73% of the collection in responsible materials.\nTogether with most of our industry, we define a material as responsible if at least 50% of the main material composition is certified with a relevant certificate or trademark that has a proven lower environmental impact in comparison to the conventional alternative. This includes Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified cotton and Global Recycling Standard (GRS) certified recycled polyester to name a few.\nWe know it’s difficult to keep track of, so we’ve made it easy for you. Look for our responsible hang tags when shopping in store or at GANNI.com to quickly spot our responsible product. ",
