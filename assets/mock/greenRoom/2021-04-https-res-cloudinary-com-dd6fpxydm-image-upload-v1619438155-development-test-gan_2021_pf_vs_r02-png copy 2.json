  "text": "TRACEABILITY\n\nIn our journey towards becoming more responsible, we're in the process of uncovering our impact from an environmental and social perspective.\nAs fashion supply chains are historically long and complex, gaining traceability is crucial for driving meaningful change.\nWe’re proud to now share a map of all our Tier 1 contractual manufacturers to drive transparency. All information will also be published in the Open Apparel Registry, an open-source map and database of global apparel facilities and in our responsibility report.\n\nWe’ve signed a code of conduct securing workers rights with all our Tier 1 manufacturers. Thing is these have subcontractors, we have no legal power over. This is why traceability is so important. We’re proud to currently have 87% traceability from Stage 1-4, of our supply chain and are working on full visibility down to the raw material level by 2022. Stick with us as we work towards 100% traceability",
