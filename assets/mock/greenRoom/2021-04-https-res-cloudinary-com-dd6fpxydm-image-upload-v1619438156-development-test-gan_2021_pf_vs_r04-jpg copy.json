  "text": "CAN TECHNOLOGY SOLVE FASHION’S WASTE ISSUE?\n\nWe’re currently implementing innovative digital solutions including a 3D Design Tool by 2022 to reduce the number of samples we produce and ship.\n\nIn December 2020, our Ready to Wear design team and technicians embarked on a five day training programme for 3D design tool, @itsclo3d, a fashion design software that can support companies like ours in creating virtual, true to life garments.\n\nWorking with @itsclo3d enables us to reduce the number of samples it takes to bring GANNI styles to life. Around 40% of our samples require a second proto-type. This is the phase we are trying to cut down on. Our aim is to use @itsclo3d to visualise the design and technical aspects to become less reliant on back and forth sample rounds with suppliers.\n\n“We’ve just dipped our toes in @itsclo3d, but the possibilities for what we can do seem endless. We just began working with a fabric scanner, making the sketches extremely lifelike,” explains garment technician Louise Bistrup Strøm.\nStay tuned, we’ll make sure to keep you updated on our digital endeavours\n",
