We recognise the inherent contradiction between the current fashion industry that thrives off newness and consumption, and the concept of sustainability. \n\nSo instead, we're focused on becoming the most responsible version of ourselves. Committed to making better choices every day across the business to minimise our social and environmental impact. We see this as our moral obligation. \n\nWe've been pretty reserved in communicating about it in the past, mainly because we're scared of being called out for greenwashing. But we need to make more responsible choices, so it's easier for you to make them too. In the wake of a growing climate emergency every action matters. ",
